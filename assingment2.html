                <h2>Pollution</h2>
                <p><i> Learn about different types of pollution and their impact on our environment </i>
                    Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.[1] Pollution can take the form of any substance <span> (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light)</span>. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.


                    <b>Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that the contaminants have an anthropogenic source </b> – that is, a source created by human activities, such as manufacturing, extractive industries, poor waste management, transportation or agriculture. Pollution is often classed as point source <span>(coming from a highly concentrated specific site, such as a factory, mine, construction site)</span>, or nonpoint source pollution (coming from a widespread distributed sources, such as microplastics or agricultural runoff).</p>
                    <u>Many sources of pollution were unregulated parts of industrialization during the 19th and 20th centuries until the emergence of environmental regulation and pollution policy in the later half of the 20th century.</u> Sites where historically polluting industries released persistent pollutants may have legacy pollution long after the source of the pollution is stopped. Major forms of pollution include air pollution, water pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, light pollution, and visual pollution.


                    <span class="a">Pollution has widespread consequences on human and environmental health, having systematic impact on social and economic systems. In 2019, pollution killed nine million people worldwide (one in six deaths), a number unchanged since 2015</span>.[2][3][4] Air pollution accounted for 3⁄4 of these earlier deaths.[5][6] A 2022 literature review found that levels of anthropogenic chemical pollution have exceeded planetary boundaries and now threaten entire ecosystems around the world.[7][8] Pollutants frequently have outsized impacts on vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly, and marginalized communities, because polluting industries and toxic waste sites tend to be collocated with populations with less economic and political power. <span class="a">[9] This outsized impact is a core reason for the formation of the environmental justice movement,[10][11] and continues to be a core element of environmental conflicts, particularly in the Global South.</span>

                <p><i>Understand the causes, effects, and control measures for air pollution.</i>
                    <span> Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances called pollutants in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.</span>[1] It is also the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment either by chemical, physical, or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere.[1] There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases  <b> (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons)</b>,<span class="a"> particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules.</span>Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain).[2] Air pollution can be caused by both human activities[3] and natural phenomena

                <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
                <p><i>Explore the sources and consequences of water pollution and its solutions.</i>
                    <span>Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, with a negative impact on their uses.[1]: 6  It is usually a result of human activities. Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater</span>. Water pollution results when contaminants mix with these water bodies. Contaminants can come from one of four main sources. These are sewage discharges, industrial activities, agricultural activities, and urban runoff including stormwater.[2] Water pollution may affect either surface water or groundwater. <span class="a"> This form of pollution can lead to many problems. One is the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Another is spreading water-borne diseases when people use polluted water for drinking or irrigation.</span> 3 Water pollution also reduces the ecosystem services such as drinking water provided by the water resource.


                    <b>Sources of water pollution are either point sources or non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause, such as a storm drain, a wastewater treatment plant or an oil spill. Non-point sources are more diffuse. An example is agricultural runoff.</b>[4] <span>Pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. Pollution may take many forms. One would is toxic substances such as oil, metals, plastics, pesticides, persistent organic pollutants, and industrial waste products.</span> Another is stressful conditions such as changes of pH, hypoxia or anoxia, increased temperatures, excessive turbidity, or changes of salinity. <span>The introduction of pathogenic organisms is another. Contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers.</span>

                <h2>Noise Pollution</h2>
                <p><i>Gain knowledge about noise pollution, its health impacts, and prevention methods.</i>
                    <b>Noise pollution, or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise or sound with ranging impacts on the activity of human or animal life, most of which are harmful to a degree.</b> <span>The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport and propagation systems.[1][2][3] Poor urban planning may give rise to noise disintegration or pollution, side-by-side industrial and residential buildings can result in noise pollution in the residential areas.</span> Some of the main sources of noise in residential areas include loud music, transportation (traffic, rail, airplanes, etc.), lawn care maintenance, construction, electrical generators, wind turbines, explosions and people.


                
                    <u>Documented problems associated with noise in urban environments go back as far as ancient Rome.</u> [4] Research suggests that noise pollution in the United States is the highest in low-income and racial minority neighborhoods,[5] <span class="a">and noise pollution associated with household electricity generators is an emerging environmental degradation in many developing nations.[6]</span>


                    High noise levels can contribute to cardiovascular effects in humans and an increased incidence of coronary artery disease.[7][8] In animals, noise can increase the risk of death by altering predator or prey detection and avoidance, interfere with reproduction and navigation, and contribute to permanent hearing loss.[9] A substantial amount of the noise that humans produce occurs in the ocean. Up until recently, most research on noise impacts has been focused on marine mammals, and to a lesser degree, fish.[10][11] In the past few years, scientists have shifted to conducting studies on invertebrates and their responses to anthropogenic sounds in the marine environment. This research is essential, especially considering that invertebrates make up 75% of marine species, and thus compose a large percentage of ocean food webs.[11] <span> Of the studies that have been conducted, a sizable variety in families of invertebrates have been represented in the research. A variation in the complexity of their sensory systems exists, which allows scientists to study a range of characteristics and develop a better understanding of anthropogenic noise impacts on living organisms</span>

                <h2>Plastic Pollution</h2>
                <p><i>Read about the severity of plastic pollution and its solutions for a cleaner planet.</i>
                    Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles <u>(e.g. plastic bottles, bags and microbeads) in the Earth's environment that adversely affects humans, wildlife and their habitat.[1][2] Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized by size into micro-, meso-, or macro debris.</u>[3] Plastics are inexpensive and durable, making them very adaptable for different uses; as a result, manufacturers choose to use plastic over other materials.[4] However, the chemical structure of most plastics renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation and as a result they are slow to degrade.[5] <span>Together, these two factors allow large volumes of plastic to enter the environment as mismanaged waste which persists in the ecosystem and travels throughout food webs.[6][7]</span> 


                    Plastic pollution can afflict land, waterways and oceans. It is estimated that 1.1 to 8.8 million tonnes of plastic waste enters the ocean from coastal communities each year. <span class="a"> It is estimated that there is a stock of 86 million tons of plastic marine debris in the worldwide ocean as of the end of 2013, with an assumption that 1.4% of global plastics produced from 1950 to 2013 has entered the ocean and has accumulated there.</span>


                    [9] <b> Global plastic production has surged from 1.5 million tons in the 1950s to 335 million tons in 2016, resulting in environmental concerns.</b><span> A significant issue arises from the inefficient treatment of 79% of plastic products, leading to their release into landfills or natural environments.</span>

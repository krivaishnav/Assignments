            <p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.[1] Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.

                Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that the contaminants have an anthropogenic source that is, a source created by human activities, such as manufacturing, extractive industries, poor waste management, transportation or agriculture. Pollution is often classed as point source (coming from a highly concentrated specific site, such as a factory, mine, construction site), or nonpoint source pollution (coming from a widespread distributed sources, such as microplastics or agricultural runoff)  </p>

            <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
            <img src="waterpollution.JPG" alt="Water Pollution">
            <p>Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, with a negative impact on their uses.[1]:â€ŠIt is usually a result of human activities. Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants mix with these water bodies. Contaminants can come from one of four main sources. These are sewage discharges, industrial activities, agricultural activities, and urban runoff including stormwater.[2] Water pollution may affect either surface water or groundwater. This form of pollution can lead to many problems. One is the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Another is spreading water-borne diseases when people use polluted water for drinking or irrigation.[3] Water pollution also reduces the ecosystem services such as drinking water provided by the water resource.</p>
